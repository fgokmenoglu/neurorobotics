## 1. Hardware Overview

Our setup consists of several key physical components. Familiarize yourself with each one.

### The KUKA LBR iiwa Robot Arm

*(A paragraph describing the KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800, its payload capacity, reach, and its role as a haptic interface in our research.)*

### The Sunrise Controller Cabinet

*(A paragraph explaining that the controller is the "brain" of the robot, running a Windows-based OS where our Java applications are executed. Mention key connection ports like Ethernet and USB.)*

### The smartHMI (smartPAD)

*(A paragraph describing the smartPAD as our primary interface for direct control, running applications, and diagnosing issues. Highlight the enabling switches and emergency stop button.)*

## 2. Software and Development Workflow

Our development happens on a separate PC and is then transferred to the robot controller.

### KUKA Sunrise.Workbench
